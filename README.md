Heart Attack Data Visualization and Prediction Dashboard
This project creates a data visualization and prediction dashboard for analyzing heart attack trends and predicting risks using machine learning. The dashboard uses a dataset from Kaggle, preprocesses the data, trains a predictive model, and displays insights and evaluation metrics in an interactive Streamlit app.

Project Objectives
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing and inconsistent data using Pandas.
Normalize numerical columns and encode categorical features for machine learning.
Data Visualization:

Create insightful visualizations (e.g., trends by age, gender, BMI) using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore relationships in the data.
Machine Learning Predictions:

Use Logistic Regression from scikit-learn to train and test a model predicting heart attack risks.
Evaluate the model using:
Confusion Matrix
ROC Curve
Feature Importance
Interactive Dashboard:

Build an intuitive dashboard with Streamlit to display:
Pre-trained visualizations.
Prediction metrics.
Model evaluation insights.
Technologies Used
Python 3.8+
Libraries:
Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
scikit-learn for machine learning.
Streamlit for building the dashboard.
Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about heart attack cases in Germany (2015â€“2023) for youth (under 25) and adults (25+). Features include health, lifestyle, and environmental factors.

Key Features:
Health Factors: BMI, Cholesterol Level, Hypertension, etc.
Lifestyle Factors: Smoking Status, Alcohol Consumption, Diet Quality.
Environmental Factors: Air Pollution Index, Region.
Socioeconomic Factors: Education Level, Employment Status, Income Level.
Target Variable: Heart_Attack_Incidence (0 = No Heart Attack, 1 = Heart Attack).
Workflow
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and outliers.
Encode categorical variables.
Normalize numerical variables using StandardScaler.
Data Visualization:

Analyze heart attack trends by age, gender, BMI, and smoking habits.
Create region-wise and year-wise heart attack trends.
Model Training and Testing:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a Logistic Regression model using fit and evaluate predictions with predict and predict_proba.
Model Evaluation:

Generate the following evaluation metrics:
Confusion Matrix: Show correct and incorrect predictions.
ROC Curve: Measure the model's ability to classify cases.
Feature Importance: Display the impact of features on predictions.
Streamlit Dashboard:

Display EDA graphs (trends and relationships).
Present model predictions and performance metrics interactively.

Sample Visualizations
EDA Graphs:

Heart attack trends by age and gender.
BMI distribution and its impact on heart attack incidence.
Yearly and regional heart attack trends.
Evaluation Metrics:

Confusion Matrix
ROC Curve (with AUC score)
Feature Importance Plot

Future Enhancements
allow users to dynamically filter and customize the displayed data 
Deploy the dashboard to a cloud platform like Streamlit Cloud or AWS.
